# Numpy

## Basic Requirements on OS
* pip
* python

## Installation of Pandas
``` bash
pip install pandas
```
## Installing ipython
```bash
pip install ipython

* IPython is just like the normal shell you get when you run `python`, but IPython provides better printing for large text. This ability makes IPython suitable for data analysis because the program prints data in a well-structured format.

pip install opencv-python #Open CV is the image processing library. It is referred as cv2.

#If My OpenCV installation didn't work on Windows
pip uninstall opencv-python

#Download a wheel (.whl) file from this link and install the file with pip. Make sure you download the correct file for your #Windows and your Python versions. For example, for Python 3.6 on Windows 64-bit you would do this:
pip install opencv_python‑3.2.0‑cp36‑cp36m‑win_amd64.whl 

#Try to import cv2 in Python again. If there's still an error, type the following again in the command line:
pip install opencv-python 
```
